    <h1>This is for week 1 course</h1>
    <h2>Hi, my name is Ian Nuno, </h2>
        <h3> I was born on June 8th, 2001. I started San Diego Mesa College in Fall 2020 and I aspire to be a software developer. The reason why I'm taking this course is because it is my major requirement to graduate, I'm interested in ideas of content creations from video editing and photography growing up! I've had experience with softwares such as Premiere Pro, Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator that I've used in my previous WebDesign courses. </h3>

        I want to exit this course that will make me recap and find out what I learned something new that would benefit useful in the future and use it for personal creativity to post on platforms such as Instagram, YouTube, TikTok and Twitch in the near future!
    <ul> My hobbies are:
        <li>Listeing to music.</li>
        <li>Watching Movies and TV Shows</li>
        <li>Going outdoors</li>
      </ul>
